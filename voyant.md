The Cirrus diagram appeared pretty much as expected.

God, Jesus, Christ, Lord are all to be expected. But one term I was curious about was "church" which was the 11th most frequent term. I can't imagine that people were (or are) terribly accepting of crossdressers and trans people in church communities. How was this addressed by Grace and Lace?

Looking closer at some sentences containing the word "church", I can see the concern about other people would think as well as discussion about generally avoiding contact with other churchgoers.

A phrase that I was also interested in associated with "church" was "church member." There are much fewers instances of this phrase of course, but they seem to either describe disproval from church members or how the author's ability to love and accept others (as God would have wanted) is greater than the other church members'.

The 12th most frequent term, "god's", was also of interest to me. I wondered what kinds of things were associated possesively with God in these papers.

As you can see, God is associated with very positive things here. It seem's like a lot of the content of these papers are reconciliating how the authors see God, and how their fellow Christians see him. 

I've also realized that some of the contents of these papers are letters asking for advice. So I searched for the term "help".
