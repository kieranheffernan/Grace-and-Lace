# Introduction
*Grace and Lace* is "an evangelical Christian publication for crossdressers, transgendered, and transsexuals published in Jackson, Mississippi" as described by the Digtal Transgender Archive. I converted all of the available documents to textfiles and analyzed them using Voyant, AntConc, and topic modelling.
