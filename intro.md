# Introduction
*Grace and Lace* is "an evangelical Christian publication for crossdressers, transgendered, and transsexuals published in Jackson, Mississippi" in the 1990s, as described by the Digital Transgender Archive. I converted all of the available documents to textfiles and analyzed them using Voyant and AntConc.
